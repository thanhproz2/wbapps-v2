          <p><strong>To upload Project Files:</strong></p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              The following process is for Curators working on content provided
              by another member as part of a Project when edited clips are ready
              to be uploaded.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you are working on a current Curation Project, a button will
              appear in your "WORKSPACE" tab that says, "Upload Project Files".
              This button will not be visible to you if you are not currently
              working on a Collaborative Project.<br />
              Clicking on the "Upload Project Files" button will send you to the
              project page in the "MY COLLABORATION" tab. From that project
              page, you can upload your final edited clips.
            </li>

            <li>
              Once the clips are uploaded, you will find them in the "WORKSPACE"
              tab where you can add metadata and submit the clips.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p><strong>To share content ownership and revenue: </strong></p>

          <p>
            You can add Sharers and assign them an ownership percentage of the
            content within the metadata "Edit" section of the "WORKPLACE" tab.
          </p>
          <p>
            For a collaborative project, you can specify the Curator and
            Sharers’ ownership percentages in the "Create a Project" window of
            the "MY COLLABORATION" tab when setting up a new project.
          </p>
          <p>
            BlackBox will then automatically distribute the submitted content to
            global markets (i.e. our partner agencies). Every time shared
            content sells, BlackBox will automatically split the revenue among
            all sharers involved.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p><strong>To create a collaborative curation project:</strong></p>

          <p>
            In the &ldquo;MY COLLABORATION&rdquo; tab, create a new project and
            select the project type "Curation Project". In the following window,
            you can select your collaborators (Curator and Sharers).
          </p>
          <p>
            NOTE: At this time, you can only select one Curator, but can add
            multiple Sharer(s).
          </p>
          <p>
            You can pick your own Curator or you can post the project to the
            "MARKETPLACE" where qualified Curators can request to collaborate on
            your project.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Curator can submit edited footage on your behalf, which you need
            to approve before submitting the project for distribution to the
            agencies.
          </p>

                When creating a new project, you can set the project as
                "Private" or as "Marketplace".<br />
                If your project is set as "Private", then only the Curator you
                have selected will be able to see your project in their
                "MARKETPLACE" tab. An email will be sent to that curator asking
                them to accept or reject the project.
              </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                If your project is set as "Marketplace", then any member can
                express an interest in curating your project and you can approve
                the Curator you prefer.

                When creating a new project, the "Save" button will save the
                unpublished project to your "MY COLLABORATION" tab and will not
                post it to the "MARKETPLACE" yet.<br />
                "Submit" will submit your project to the "MARKETPLACE" tab.

                Interested Collaborators and Curators can chat with the Project
                Owner to ask for more information about the project and the work
                involved.<br />
                After the Project Owner assigns a Curator, that Curator can then
                accept or reject the project assignment.

                Once the Curator finishes the curation work, they can then
                upload the finished clips on behalf of the Project Owner for
                approval.<br />
                In the "MY COLLABORATION" tab, the Curator can use the “Upload
                project files” button within the project to upload the finished
                footage. The project name becomes the "batch name" for the
                Curator’s organizational purposes.<br />
                Uploaded footage will become visible in the "WORKSPACE" tab for
                the final steps of metadata curation before finally submitting
                the clips.

                After submitting the footage on the Project Owner's behalf, the
                Curator can mark the Project as “complete”. The Project owner
                will get an email notification so they can either approve the
                footage or simply mark the Project “complete”.<br />
                NOTE: If the Project Owner marks the Project as “complete”
                before approving the individual clips, all the footage within
                that Project will be automatically approved.
